## Web-CAT Submission Energy

The submission energy bar is a new feature that has been added to Web-CAT as a research project and an aid to students.  This page helps outline some of the questions, as well as some of the background with the energy bar.  If you have additional questions, feel free to post them on Piazza.  We will update this FAQ over time.

 
### Where did the idea come from?

The idea of the submission energy bar came from many mobile games (like Clash of Clans) in which the user is given a limit on the number of actions they can perform, but the limit replenishes over time.  Research has shown that such systems have changed the behavior of gamers from infrequent binge-playing consisting of many hours to more frequent gaming of only a few minutes.  The question arose how this might be applied to education to help students with assignments.  Thus, the submission energy bar was born.

 

### Why was the energy bar developed?

There are two primary reasons...

1. **Help students get better grades.**  If you start earlier, you will have the opportunity to make more submissions and get more feedback.  Earlier feedback gives you more time to ask questions in class, visit office hours, or participate in discussions in class forums.  And finally, it allows you recognize opportunities to apply what you hear in class to your assignments.
2. **Help make Web-CAT more responsive.** Often, Web-CAT is crippled within the last few hours of a deadline due to the number of students making submissions.  This dramatically limits the number of students that can submit and get feedback.  Since the energy bar limits the number of submissions, it requires you to think about what you're actually submitting, rather than submitting each JavaDoc fix as a separate submission.  By reducing the number of submissions, Web-CAT is better enabled to help provide you with quicker feedback, making each submission better.
 

### What strategies can I apply to get the most out of the energy bar?

- **Start working earlier.** By working earlier, you will get the opportunity to make more submissions.  As you work earlier, you can recognize how labs, lecture, and other assignments provide clues on how to complete the assignments.  It's hard to recognize these if you wait until the last minute.
- **Make the most of each submission.** If Web-CAT indicated you have several JavaDoc errors, try to fix as many as possible before making a new submission.  Try to fix or add test cases.  Basically, make smart submissions.
 

### What happens if I submit, but have no energy?

The submission will be accepted, but the results page will display an error indicating that you have no submission energy.  Simply wait until the next slot is recharged and resubmit. 

 

### The deadline is approaching! Help!

The last hour before the deadline is not rate-limited.  In other words, you can make as many submissions as needed during the last hour.  But, be aware that many other students may be doing so too, which will delay feedback. As noted before, be sure to make the most of each submission.

 

### Who's research is this?

The research effort has been approved by the Virginia Tech Institutional Review Board (IRB) and is lead by Dr. Stephen Edwards.  Michael Irwin (one of the instructors for this course) is using this research for his Masters thesis.  All research data will be analyzed anonymously and consent forms providing additional details related to the study, data collected, etc. will be provided at a future date.  Until then, no analysis will be performed.

 

### What data is being collected?

Web-CAT already collects all submissions made, including timestamps and the submission itself.  The only new data being collected as part of the energy bar research are events related to the energy bar - when a slot is consumed, when a submission is denied due to no energy, etc.

 
### Can I opt out of the energy bar?

In order to ensure all students are treated fairly, no. Students may not opt out of the use of the energy bar.  However, each student will be given the opportunity to have his/her data removed before analysis.
